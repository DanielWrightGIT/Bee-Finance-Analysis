# Project Overview
The purpose of this project is to gain insight into the financial effects of the declining honey bee (*Apis Mellifera Linnaeus*) population in the United States. "Honey bees alone pollinate 80 percent of all flowering plants, including more than 130 types of fruits and vegetables” (1) making them a keystone species and essential for the reproduction of non-asexual flora. 

# Data
The data was retrieved in the form of a CSV file from Kaggle.com and provided by the National Agricultural Statistics Service of the USDA https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/mohitpoudel/us-honey-production-19952021.
